'<a class="content" href="http://www.scottbot.net/HIAL/?p=6279">Network analysis</a> is a tool for identifying and quantifying relationships between people, organizations, and things. My ultimate goal is to bring network analysis together with <a class="content" href="http://carbon.ucdenver.edu/~mryder/itc/ant_dff.html">Actor Network Theory</a> to examine whether we can learn more using these two approaches together. As of yet, those who use network analysis do not ground their approach in actor network theory, and those who follow the actor network theory tradition rarely (if ever) formalize the networks they discuss.\
<p>Here, I examine networks produced through the process of scholarly publication in the field of population science. My corpus consists of all articles in the <a class="content" href="http://jstor.org">JSTOR</a> corpus published between 1925 and 2004 in the journals <i>American Economic Review</i>, <i>American Journal of Sociology</i>, <i>American Sociological Review</i>, <i>Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science</i>, <i>Biometrics</i>, <i>Biometrika</i>, <i>Demography</i>, <i>Economic Development and Cultural Change</i>, <i>Economic Geography</i>, <i>Economic History Review</i>, <i>European Journal of Population</i>, <i>Family Planning Perspectives</i>, <i>Genus</i>, <i>GeoJournal</i>, <i>Human Biology</i>, <i>International Family Planning Perspectives</i>, <i>International Migration Review</i>, <i>Journal of Agricultural Economics</i>, <i>Journal of the American Statistical Association</i>, <i>Journal of Economic History</i>, <i>Journal of Interdisciplinary History</i>, <i>Journal of Marriage and Family</i>, <i>Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly</i>, <i>Population and Development Review</i>, <i>Population Economics</i>, <i>Population and Environment</i>, <i>Population Index</i>, <i>Population Research and Policy Review</i>, <i>Population Studies</i>, <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, <i>Public Health Reports</i>, <i>Science</i>, <i>Social Forces</i>, <i>Social History</i>, <i>Social Indicators Research</i>, <i>Social Science History</i>, <i>Studies in Family Planning</i>, <i>Transactions of the Faculty of Actuaries</i>, and <i>William and Mary Quarterly</i>. I include all articles that use the word "population" and either "fertility," "migration," or "mortality."\
<p>All of the networks I show here are unimodal. That is, in the <a class="content" href="jnet1925.html">Journal Networks</a> section, journals are linked to journals, via authors who published in both in a given decade. In the <a class="content" href="anet1925.html">Author Networks</a> section, authors are linked to other authors, via articles co-authored in a given decade. In each section, the arrows at the top of the pages allow for navigation between decades.\
<p>In the journal networks, nodes represent journals and ties represent authors. A thicker line linking two journals indicates more authors who published in both journals. The size of the node is proportional to the number of population articles published in a journal in the given decade. Journals are color-coded according to nine disciplines - Demography, Economics, Eugenics, Family Planning, Geography, History, Public Health, Sociology, and Statistics - as shown in the Legend. There is also a category for general journals, which includes <i>Annals of the American Association of Political and Social Science</i>, <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, <i>Science</i>, and <i>Social Indicators Research</i>. The diagrams are produced using the force layout in <a class="content" href="http://d3js.org">D3</a>. Mousing over a node will reveal the full title of the journal, and the nodes can be moved or repositioned by clicking and dragging.\
<p>The text below the diagram indicates, for each decade, the number of articles, number of journals, and number of authors. The network density is calculated as the proportion of possible ties that actually exist, counting only one possible tie per journal pair. That is, in 1925-1934, there are twelve journals. Each journal could tie to a maximum of eleven other journals (for this calculation, the weight of the tie - the number of authors publishing in two given journals - is ignored), so the total number of possible ties is 11+10+9+8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1=66. Counting only one of the possible ties between any two journals, the network has 23 ties, so the density of the network is 23/66=0.35. Network density indicates the degree to which a network is connected within itself. The centrality of each journal is calculated as the number of other journals to which it ties, divided by the maximum number of journals to which it could tie, which in 1925-1934 is 11. In that decade, the <i>Journal of the American Statistical Association (JASA)</i> is tied to <i>American Economic Review</i>, <i>American Journal of Sociology</i>, <i>Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science</i>, <i>Human Biology</i>, <i>Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly</i>, <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>, <i>Public Health Reports</i>, and <i>Social Forces</i>. These 8 journals represent 73% of the total possible journals to which <i>JASA</i> could link, so its centrality is 0.73. Finally, for each author who published in more than two journals during the decade, the author is listed (authors with the most articles listed first), along with the year, article title, and journal, color coded by field of the journal and linked to the journal article in <a class="content" href="http://jstor.org">JSTOR</a>.\
<p>In the author networks, nodes represent authors and ties represent articles. As before, nodes are proportional to the number of population articles (not necessarily co-authored) published by an author in a given decade, and thicker ties represent more articles co-authored by a given pair of authors. Nodes are color-coded according to the predominant discipline represented by the journals in which they published in that decade. So, if someone published one article in <i>International Migration Review</i>, one in <i>Population Studies</i>, and one in the <i>American Economic Review</i>, his or her node would be colored dark blue for demography. Nodes that represent <a class="content" href="../paa/paa.html">PAA</a> presidents are labeled with their name, but the name associated with any node can be seen by mousing over. Also labeled are prominent figures in the broader dissertation: Bernard Berelson, Paul R. Ehrlich, Garrett Hardin, Oscar Harkavy, W. Parker Mauldin, Hugh Moore, Fairfield Osborn, Raymond Pearl, and William Vogt. Below the diagram is listed the number of authors represented, the density of the network (calculated as above) and the number of components, or separate sub-networks, in the network. Only components that contain a PAA president (or prominent figure listed above) are included. Unconnected authors are shown only if they were ever president of PAA (or listed above) and are not included in the count of components. \
<p>In 1925-1934, there are four components: the largest is centered on Louis Dublin, followed by the component centered on Frank Notestein. Each of the other components has only two authors: Harold F Dorn and Samuel A. Stouffer; and Raymond Pearl and Dewitt Pearl. Density is listed for each component, and the degree centrality within that component is given for all nodes. In 1925-1934, Dublin\'s component is the largest, with 9 nodes. Of the 36 possible ties in that component (8+7+6+5+4+3+2+1), 15, or 42% are present, so the density of the component is 0.42. Within each component, authors are listed from most central to least central, with centrality calculated as above. In the largest component, Dublin is linked to everyone else, so his centrality is 1. Robinson C. Newcomb, H. Morton Bodfish, Pascal K. Whelpton, and Richard T. Ely follow, each with a centrality of 0.5, as each has a tie to four of the other eight members of the component. Herbert H. Marks and Alfred J. Lotka are the least central, as each only links to Dublin.\
