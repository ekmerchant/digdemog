'The <a class="content" href="alltopics.html">All Topics</a> page lists the topics generated by latent dirichlet analysis for the collection of all articles from <i>Population Studies</i> (1947-2010), <i>Demography</i> (1964-2010), and <i>Population and Development Review</i> (1975-2010). Topics are listed by number; word clouds show the relative distribution of words of that defines each topic and a graph shows the prevalence of each topic as proportion of the corpus over time. Links to pages for each individual topic show the number of articles representing that topic in each journal by year. The <a class="content" href="topjournal.html">Topics by Journal</a> page groups topics into themes and graphs the relative prevalence of themes in each journal over time, smoothed by a three-year moving average. Here, I discuss each topic individually, describe how and why topics are grouped into themes, and how those themes are represented in each journal over the period.\
<hr>\
<dl>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic1.html">Topic 1</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prevalent words in this topic are "India," "sex," and "women," followed by such words as "son," "girls," and "ratio," suggesting that this cluster of words is used to discuss sex ratio at birth and child sex preferences in India. The prevalence of this topic increases after 1975, when ultrasound technology made sex-selective abortion possible. Topic 1 is most prevalent in the U.K.-based <i>Population Studies</i>, followed by <i>Population and Development Review</i>, which focuses on the global south.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic2.html">Topic 2</a></dt>\
<dd>Prevalent words in this topic include "Europe" and "western," suggesting that these words refer to historical European population trends. Also prevalent are "Germany" and "Japan," countries that were considered to have followed Western European population trends in the twentieth century, and the words "world" and "developing." This distribution, together with the list of articles reflective of this topic, suggests that this cluster of words is used to discuss the possibility that future population trends outside of Europe will follow the trends established within Europe in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This topic is most prevalent in <i>Population and Development Review</i>, reflecting the journal\'s concern with future population trends in the global south.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic3.html">Topic 3</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prevalent word in Topic 3 is "age," followed by "rates," "table," "years," "data," and "mortality," suggesting that this cluster of words refers to quantitative analysis of age-specific vital rates, mainly mortality but also fertility. This topic is most prevalent in <i>Population Studies</i> and <i>Demography</i>, both of which emphasize quantitative analysis, and its prevalence peaks between 1965, with the establishment of <i>Demography</i> and 1985, when concern with fertility in the global south lost its predominance within the field of population science.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic4.html">Topic 4</a></dt>\
<dd>Topic 4 focuses on China, with the words "China," "Chinese," and "population" most prominent. China has long been recognized as the most populous country, though prior to the 1960s, the exact size of its population was a mystery to demographers in the U.S. and Western Europe. This topic is most prevalent in <i>Population and Development Review</i> and particularly prominent after the 1979 introduction of China\'s "One-Child" Policy.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic5.html">Topic 5</a></dt>\
<dd>Topic 5 is one of the least prevalent topics in the corpus, and the words that comprise it are relatively evenly distributed. These include "human" and "genetic," followed by "biological," "selection," and "evolutionary." These words suggest biodemography or eugenics, an impression that is further substantiated by the list of articles, which includes twin studies and studies of the relationship between fertility, class, and intelligence. Given the sparsity of this topic in the corpus, large spikes, like that apparent in 2003, can be produced by a single article, in this case a study of drosophila (fruit fly) longevity in <i>Population and Development Review</i></dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic6.html">Topic 6</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prevalent words in Topic 6 are "population" and "model," followed by "time" and "distribution," suggesting a cluster of words used to discuss quantitative modeling of population and population change over time. This topic is most prevalent in <i>Demography</i>, the journal with the strongest emphasis on quantitative methods, and peaks from about 1968 to 1990.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic7.html">Topic 7</a></dt>\
<dd>The decline in prevalence of Topic 6 after 1990 might be related to the rise of Topic 7, the prevalence of which increases steadily with the establishment of <i>Demography</i> in 1964. With such words as "effects," "model," "variables," "significant," and "table," it is clear that this topic describes regression analysis, the use of which increased along with the increase of individual-level data collection and computing in the social sciences.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic8.html">Topic 8</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prevalent word in Topic 8 is "birth," followed by "child," "months," "interval," "age," "pregnancy," and "breastfeeding," suggesting fertility analysis broadly and birth interval analysis more specifically. This topic is most prevalent in <i>Population Studies</i>.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic9.html">Topic 9</a></dt>\
<dd>Topic 9 contains words associated with European historical demography, with "England" and "century" most prominent, followed by "nineteenth," "class," and "war." <i>Population Studies</i> has the largest number of articles associated with this topic, reflecting its focus on Europe and European history.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic10.html">Topic 10</a></dt>\
<dd>Topic 10 is dominated by the words "rural," "urban," and "areas," followed by "migration," suggesting that this cluster of words refers to rural-urban migration. This topic is most prevalent in <i>Demography</i> and declines in prominence after 1985, reflecting either a decline in rural-urban migration or a decline of interest in rural-urban migration as patterns of urbanization became established.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic11.html">Topic 11</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prominent words in Topic 11 are "age" and "life," followed by "years," "death," and "expectancy," suggesting that this topic references mortality. This topic is represented in all three journals, and its prevalence increases steadily after 1975, reflecting global population aging (the growing proportion of world population in the older age groups).</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic12.html">Topic 12</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prominent words in Topic 12 are "family" and "children," followed by "size," "fertility," "wife," and "husband," suggesting a focus on fertility and family size. This topic is most prominently represented in <i>Population Studies</i> and <i>Demography</i>, and during the period from 1960 to 1985, when fertility and population growth worldwide were the most prominent problematics in population science. The prominence of Topic 12 during the 1960-1985 period also reflects the rise of fertility surveys as a method in population science.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic13.html">Topic 13</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prominent words in Topic 13 are "black" and "white," followed by "segregation," "race," "hispanic," and "metropolitan," suggesting that this word cluster is used to discuss U.S. race relations, especially such urban issues as segregation. This topic is almost entirely concentrated in <i>Demography</i>, where an emphasis on racial issues and urban demography was established by the journal\'s second editor, Beverly Duncan.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic14.html">Topic 14</a></dt>\
<dd>Topic 14 is dominated by a geographic focus on "Africa," which, together with "women," is the most prominent word. Close behind are "HIV," "AIDS," and "sexual." The articles that most represent this topic shift their emphasis over time from fertility and family size in the earlier period to AIDS in the later period, suggesting that that authors have consistently used many of the same words when discussing sexuality in Africa, whether that discussion emphasized fertility or pathology. This topic is most prevalent in <i>Population Studies</i> and <i>Population and Development Review</i>.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic15.html">Topic 15</a></dt>\
<dd>Topic 15 is a cluster of words used to discuss family planning, including both contraception and abortion, as indicated by the prominence of the word "planning," followed by "contraception," "abortion," "method," and "program." This topic is equally prevalent in all three journals and most prominent between 1960 and 1980, the heyday of family planning as a means of slowing world population growth. The spike in 1968 reflects a special issue of <i>Demography</i> devoted to assessing family planning programs worldwide.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic16.html">Topic 16</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prominent words in Topic 16 are "age," "women," and "birth," followed by "period," "parity," "cohorts," and "rates," indicating analysis of age- and period-specific female fertility. The fact that "women" is one of the most prominent words and "men" does not appear at all in the top words reflects the demographic convention of measuring fertility as a function of the number of women in a population (that is, fertility rates are calculated as the number of births divided by the number of woman-years of time at risk), rather than the number of men or couples in the population. This convention is arbitrary, as every child has both a biological mother and a biological father, and likely reflects the fact that it is easier to account for children born to women than to children born to men, but has the effect of designating women as the agents of childbearing and targets of population control. This topic is prevalent in all three journals, indicating the centrality of fertility analysis in the field of population science.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic17.html">Topic 17</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prominent words in Topic 17 are "child," "parents," "household," and "families," suggesting analysis of family and household structure, particularly as it affects childbearing. This topic is most prominent in <i>Demography</i>, and increases in prominence after 1975, as family structures increased in diversity.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic18.html">Topic 18</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prominent words in Topic 18 are "immigration," "immigrants," and "migrants," followed by "united" and "states," suggesting analysis of international migration, particularly (but not exclusively) to the United States. This topic is represented in all three journals, but is most prominent in <i>Demography</i>, and increases in prominence after the U.S. immigration reforms of 1965.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic19.html">Topic 19</a></dt>\
<dd>The dominant word in Topic 19 is "school," followed by "social," "secondary," "primary," and "attainment," suggesting a focus on education and returns to educational attainment. The list of articles associated with this topic, along with its concentration in <i>Demography</i>, also suggests a focus on the United States. The prevalence of this topic increases steadily after 1985, as the field of population science began to expand its focus beyond fertility.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic20.html">Topic 20</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prevalent words in Topic 20 are "demographic," "social," and "family," followed by "change," "decline," "transition," and "economic," suggesting a cluster of words used to discuss the historical experience of demographic transition and demographic transition theory. This topic is most evident in <i>Population Studies</i>, the journal with the strongest historical focus, and in <i>Population and Development Review</i>, the journal with the strongest emphasis on population change in the global south. It is most prevalent after 1975, reflecting the establishment of this journal, and declines in prominence in the early 2000s, perhaps reflecting a shift of emphasis to the new theory of second demographic transition to explain lowest-low fertility in Europe.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic21.html">Topic 21</a></dt>\
<dd>Topic 21 includes words used to discuss demographic surveys: "data" is most prominent, followed by "survey," "sample," "information," and "respondents." This topic is most prevalent in the more quantitative journals, <i>Population Studies</i> and <i>Demography</i>, and is particularly prominent in <i>Demography</i> between 1965 and 1985, the period of such large-scale fertility survey programs as Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP) of Contraception in the 1960s and the World Fertility Survey in the 1970s.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic22.html">Topic 22</a></dt>\
<dd>The words that form Topic 22 - "people," "time," "society," - do not at first glance point to any specific concept in the field of population science. The list of articles reflecting this topic reveals more theoretically-oriented articles, such as Gottlieb\'s 1949 article on optimum population, and more historically-oriented articles, such as Sauvy\'s 1951 "Some Lesser Known French Demographyers of the Eighteenth Century" and the 1954 article "The Bradlaugh-Besant Trial and the English Newspapers" by J.A. Banks. This topic is most prominent in <i>Population and Development Review</i>, specifically in its theoretical articles, such as Joseph Spengler\'s 1976 discussion of Adam Smith views about population, and in the journal\'s frequent reprints of older material, such as David Hume\'s "On the Populousness of Ancient Nations," printed in <i>PDR</i> in 1977 and John Stuart Mill\'s "On the Stationary State," printed in <i>PDR</i> in 1986./dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic23.html">Topic 23</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prevalent words in Topic 23, "disease" and "risk," followed by "conditions," "poor," "chronic," and "nutrition," point to a focus on mortality and morbidity and their social correlates. This topic rises steadily in prominence after 1995, perhaps reflecting concern with the epidemiological transition - the reduction of mortality from infectious disease and increase in mortality from chronic disease - and with population aging.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic24.html">Topic 24</a></dt>\
<dd>Topic 24 also reflects a focus on mortality, but with "infant" as one of the most prominent words, its focus is on "infant" mortality and the worldwide decline in infant mortality after World War II. It is best represented in <i>Population Studies</i>, particularly after 1965, when infant mortality was declining worldwide, but the decline was uneven, favoring those with more resources and those in societies with better sanitation and public health infrastructure.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic25.html">Topic 25</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prominent words in Topic 25 are "land" and "food," suggesting a focus on the relationship between population and the environment. "Soviet" is also prominent, and many of the articles reflective of this topic do focus on the USSR, particularly between 1960 and 1982, but it also includes articles about other regions with Soviet influence, such as South Asia and East Africa, and in the post-Cold War period, articles focus more broadly on population, land use, and energy use, suggesting that these now-worldwide issues may have first been discussed with reference to the USSR and the parts of the world with greater Soviet influence. It is also possible that this relationship is spurious and simply driven by the use of similar words in the corpus.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic26.html">Topic 26</a></dt>\
<dd>Topic 26 clearly focuses on marriage, with "married," "marital," "marriages," "women," "men," and "divorce" appearing most prominently. The prevalence of this topic in <i>Population Studies</i> and <i>Demography</i> suggests its focus on the global north. The prevalence increases from 1965 to 2000, reflecting the diversity of marital experience in the global north in the last decades of the twentieth century and efforts to create demographic models that link marital patterns to fertility patterns.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic27.html">Topic 27</a></dt>\
<dd>Topic 27 focuses on labor, and particularly on female labor force participation, with the word "women" appearing as prominently as "work," "income," "labor," and "time." This topic appears in all three journals but particularly in <i>Demography</i>, and increases in prominence after 1965, reflecting increasing female labor force participation in the United States and efforts by demographers to link female labor force participation to changes in family structure and fertility.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic28.html">Topic 28</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prominent word in Topic 28 is "census," reflecting the focus of the topic, followed by "united," "states," "occupational," and "bureau," suggesting an emphasis on the United States and on census methodology. The list of articles confirm the focus on the United States, but also include articles about censuses in other parts of the world. The topic is most prevalent in <i>Demography</i>, again reflecting its U.S. emphasis, and shows a sharp peak in the second half of the 1960s, reflecting an outpouring of scholarship analyzing the 1960 census.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic29.html">Topic 29</a></dt>\
<dd>The most prominent words in Topic 29 are "economic," "growth," "income," and "population," suggesting a focus on the economic causes and consequences of population growth, confirmed by the article list, which includes such titles as "Theory of Population and Modern Economic Analysis" by Alan Peacock and "Investment Allocation and Population Growth" by Paul Demeny. Economists are heavily represented among the authors in the article list, including Paul Demeny, Ronald Lee, Richard Easterlin, and Julian Simon. This topic is most prevalent in <i>Population and Development Review</i>, reflecting the journal\'s focus on the relationship between economic development and population change.</dd>\
<dt><a class="content" href="topic30.html">Topic 30</a></dt>\
<dd>A concern with economic development is also apparent in Topic 30, where "development" is one of the most prominent words, but the prominence of such words as "policy," "social," "government," and "planning" indicates this topic\'s policy orientation. This topic is also most prevalent in <i>Population and Development Review</i>. The spike in 1968 reflects <i>Demography\'s</i> special issue on family planning, which emphasized government family planning policies worldwide.</dd>\
