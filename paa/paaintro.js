'The <a class="content" href="http://www.populationassociation.org">Population Association \
of America</a> (PAA) was established in 1931 by New York University sociologist Henry Pratt \
Fairchild, with funds secured by Margaret Sanger from the <a class="content" href="http://www.milbank.org">Milbank \
Memorial Fund</a>. A <a class="content" href="http://geography.sdsu.edu/Research/Projects/PAA/oralhistory/The_Early_Years_of_the_PAA.pdf">history</a> \
of the early years of the PAA, written by PAA Historian John Weeks, is available online, as is a \

of oral history interviews with past PAA presidents and other officers. \
<p>Dennis Hodgson has described the PAA in its early years as a coalition of population scientists, \
birth control activists, immigration restrictionists, and eugenicists. While all of these groups \
were present, they were not as separate or well-defined as Hodgson suggests. In those early years, \
PAA members might also be classified by affiliation. These included researchers in industry, \
government, and foundations (Louis I. Dublin and Alfred J. Lotka at the Metropolitan Life \
Insurance Company; Leon Truesdell at the Census Bureau; Frank W. Notestein and Clyde V. Kiser \
at the Milbank Memorial Fund; and Warren S. Thompson and Pascal K. Whelpton at the Scripps \
Foundation for Research in Population Problems), university faculty whose research focused \
on population (sociologists Henry Pratt Fairchild at NYU, Frank H. Hankins at Smith, and \
William F. Ogburn at the University of Chicago; and biologists Raymond Pearl and Lowell J. \
Reed at The Johns Hopkins University), and population activists, notably Margaret Sanger and \
eugenicist Frederick Osborn.    \
<p>Most of the PAA\'s founders adhered, in one form or another, to a faith in the possibility \
of improving humanity through selective breeding (eugenics),  which they discussed as the \
"qualitative aspect" of population. Support for birth control and immigration restriction \
varied according to individual perceptions about whether birth control and immigration had \
a positive or negative effect on "population quality." For example, Dublin and Lotka, both \
born abroad (though Lotka to American parents), opposed immigration restriction as having \
a negative effect on the population, in both quantitative and qualitative terms. Dublin \
also opposed the legalization of birth control, believing it to have a dysgenic effect \
because its use was most prevalent among the professional middle class. Fairchild, in contrast, \
supported immigration restriction, believing the native-born to be superior to the foreign-born, \
and favored the spread of birth control as a way to reduce the birthrate among the poor. \
<p>Initially, Henry Pratt Fairchild was to be president and Margaret Sanger was to be vice-president. \
However, Frederick Osborn suggested that the organization\'s scientific reputation would suffer \
if "nonscientists" were elected to the board. Both Osborn and Sanger hoped that a scientific \
association for the study of population would support the legitimacy of their political projects \
and Sanger, agreeing with Osborn, withdrew her name. Over the first few years of its existence, \
those in the research positions came to hold the most power within the organization, and after \
Frank Notestein became the first director of the newly-established Office of Population Research \
at Princeton University in 1936, this category merged with that of university faculty members. \
Until 1954, PAA members elected a Board of Directors and the Board elected officers; Since \
1954, members of the PAA have elected officers directly. Government demographers continued \
to play a large role in the PAA through the 1960s, but since 1970, all but four presidents \
have been university faculty, mostly sociologists. \
<p>The <a class="content" href="paafields.html">PAA Presidents: Fields and Affiliations</a> \
page of this website shows the field and affiliation (at the time of presidency) for all \
presidents from 1931 to 2006. The <a  class="content" href="paatree.html">PAA Presidents: \
Intellectual Genalogy</a> page links each president back to his or her academic advisor or \
mentor, where known. Much of the information for these visualizations is drawn from the PAA \
oral history interviews. If academic advisor or mentor is unknown, presidents have been \
linked to faculty members at their Ph.D. institutions who they mentioned in their PAA \
oral history interviews, or to faculty members at their Ph.D. institutions who were there \
at the same time and worked in the same field. Further discussion of these visualizations \
can be found on the <a href="paaexp.html" class="content">Discussion of PAA Analysis</a> page.'
