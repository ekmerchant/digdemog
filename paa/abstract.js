var abst = "<p>The twentieth century was an exceptional period in the history of \
the world\'s population: it grew faster than it had before or has since, an \
became the subject of a new science &mdash;  demography &mdash; as well as a critical \
arena of intervention for states, international agencies, and non-governmental \
organizations. This dissertation examines how population became a subject of \
expertise for scientists in North America and Western Europe between the world \
wars, and how that expertise both supported and challenged postwar programs that \
aimed to shape the world\'s population by limiting fertility, particularly in \
Asia, Africa, and Latin America. \
<p> \
At the beginning of the twentieth century, scientists and policy makers in North \
America and Western Europe increasingly understood social, political, and \
economic issues in biological terms, and viewed population engineering &mdash; \
through the control of fertility and immigration &mdash; as a key tool of \
governance. Between the world wars, scientists in a variety of fields began to \
analyze population dynamics, including both the quantity of individuals and the \
socioeconomic, racial, and national composition of populations (their \
\"quality\"). After World War II, governments and international and \
nongovernmental agencies increasingly sought demographic expertise to assist \
with planning both for population &mdash; to accommodate expected changes in \
population size and/or composition &mdash; and of population &mdash; to engineer changes \
in population size and/or composition. \
<p>  \
Policy makers, philanthropists, and business leaders in the U.S. developed two \
new overpopulation discourses, each linking population growth to global \
disaster. The first was economic, attributing global poverty and inequality to \
rapid population growth in the global south. The second was environmental, \
attributing pollution and resource depletion directly to population growth. The \
proponents of these discourses called on demography for support, and raised \
substantial funding for demographic and biomedical research aimed at stemming \
fertility, particularly in the global south. Yet demographic research \
consistently failed to provide conclusive support for these overpopulation \
discourses. The dissertation concludes in 1984, when the postwar overpopulation \
discourses dissolved under political pressure from both the left &mdash; which \
called for structural solutions to poverty and environmental degradation &mdash; and \
the right &mdash; which called for neoliberal market-based solutions.";
