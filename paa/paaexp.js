Presidents: Field and Affiliations</a> page, all PAA presidents since 1986 have been \
faculty  members at universities with population research centers, and most have been \
sociologists. Between 1960 and 1986, 77% of PAA presidents were university faculty \
members, up from 43% in the period before 1960. Louis I. Dublin and Alfred J. Lotka are \
the only PAA presidents to have worked in industry while serving as president; \
 both worked for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. Those working in \
government worked in the Census Bureau (Leon Truesdell, T.J. Woofter Jr., George \
Stolnitz, Paul Glick, Jacob Siegel, and Henry Shryock Jr.), the USDA \
(Margaret Hagood), the Public Health Service (Harold F. Dorn), or in the United \
Nations or one of its specialized agencies (Conrad Taeuber). Others worked in \
government earlier in their careers, including Philip Hauser (Census) and John \
Durand (Census and UN). Warren Thompson and Pascal Whelpton were the only \
PAA presidents to work at the Scripps Foundation while serving as president, \
though several other PAA presidents worked there early in their careers, \
including Donald J. Bogue, Norman Ryder, Ronald Freedman, Harold F. Dorn, Arthur \
A. Campbell.  \
<p> \
Trends over time in the field in which PAA presidents were \
trained demonstrate that, although sociologists have always been \
well-represented among PAA presidents, there was much more disciplinary \
diversity prior to the institutionalization of demography in U.S. universities \
and particularly prior to the establishment in the 1960s of externally-funded \
population research centers. While some of these centers were affiliated with \
schools of public health (as, for example, at Harvard University and The Johns \
Hopkins University), the centers affiliated with sociology departments (such \
as those at the University of Chicago, the University of Pennsylvania, and the \
University of Michigan) have played a larger role in the leadership of the PAA. \
The diversity of affiliation prior to 1960 reflects the emergent nature of the \
field, its grounding in population politics, and the aims of its early \
practitioners to make demography relevant to policy and governance. Beginning \
in the early 1960s, with the establishment of university population research \
centers, the PAA became a more academically-focused organization dominated by \
scholars affiliated with universities that received external funding (first from \
the Ford Foundation and later from the National Institutes of Health) for \
population research. Especially since 1987, the concentration of the PAA \
presidency in university faculty members suggests an effort to assert the \
academic nature of demography and to separate it from its administrative \
applications.  \
<p> \
Of the 69 PAA presidents between 1931 and 2006, eight also \
served as president of the American Sociological Association (Henry Pratt \
Fairchild, Frank H. Hankins, Rupert B. Vance, Dorothy Swaine Thomas, Kingsley \
Davis, Philip M. Hauser, Amos H. Hawley, and Douglas S. Massey); four also \
served as president of the American Statistical Association (Louis I. \
Dublin, Alfred J. Lotka, Lowell J. Reed, and Philip M. Hauser); only Joseph J. \
Spengler also served as president of the American Economic Association. \
<p>Demography is widely considered a field that has historically been more open \
to women than were its parent disciplines. While female demographers \
experienced the same discrimination in higher education as their peers in other \
fields, the PAA did have a higher proportion of female presidents during this \
period (17%) than did the American Sociological Association (9%), the American \
Statistical Association (9%), or the American Economics Association (2.5%). \
Demographers also had considerable employment opportunities in government, \
where women faced less discrimination than in academia. Of the three female \
presidents before 1975, only Thomas was a university faculty member (Taeuber \
was a research associate at Princeton\'s Office of Population Research). \

The <a class="content" href="paatree.html">PAA Presidents: Intellectual \
Genealogy</a> page maps all 69 PAA presidents from 1931 to 2006, along with \
their academic advisors or mentors if known (or if can be inferred from the PAA \
Oral History Project interviews). In addition to the presidents, I have \
included Franklin Giddings, the Columbia sociologist wo trained five PAA \
presidents; Francis Stuart Chapin and William Fielding Ogburn, students of \
Giddings who trained a total of six PAA presidents; Samuel A. Souffer, a \
student of Ogburn who trained three PAA presidents; Walter Willcox, Frank \
Notestein\'s advisor who also got him the job at the Milbank Memorial Fund \
that led to his selection as first director of Princeton\'s Office of Population \
Research, and is reputed to have been a student of Giddings; Roderick McKenzie,  \
the Chicago School sociologist who trained Amos Hawley at the University of Michigan; \
and Talcott Parsons and Edward P. \
Hutchinson, Harvard sociologists who trained Kingsley Davis and Dudley Kirk, \
respectively.    \

Nodes are placed horizontally according to the date of the \
Ph.D. (corresponding to the x-axis), and vertically according to the date of  \
presidency of the earliest president in a given "tree" (corresponding to the \
y-axis). Nodes are colored according to the institution at which the person \
completed the Ph.D. and links are given the same color as the target node. \
<p>Many early and some later presidents could not be linked to academic mentors. \
In the early years, these include Henry Pratt Fairchild, who completed his \
Ph.D. at Yale; Louis I. Dublin and Lowell J. Reed, who completed Ph.D.s at \
Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania, respectively, but in biology; \
Alfred J. Lotka and Dorothy S. Thomas, who completed their Ph.D.s abroad; Leon \
Truesdell and Pascall Whelpton, who may or may not have completed Ph.D.s; \
and Joseph J. Spengler, who completed all of his education at the Ohio State \
University. In the later years, C. Horace Hamilton did not have a Ph.D.; \
Calvin F. Schmid completed his at the University of Pittsburgh; Etienne Van de \
Walle completed his education abroad; Anne R. Pebley completed her Ph.D. at \
Cornell University, and Andrw J. Cherlin, S. Philip Morgan, and J. Richard Udry \
all completed degrees in the Southwest (at UCLA, and the University of \
Arizona, and USC, respectively). In the early years, many of those who could not \
be linked to advisors had degrees in statistics or biology, fields that were \
not represented in the PAA presidency after 1945.  \
<p> \
Linking scholars to their primary advisors reveals the interpersonal and intra-institutional \
connections \
within the field, but may also obscure connections between individuals that \
spanned institutions, connections between institutions, and multiple influences \
on the individual intellectual development. For example, this genealogy \
indicates that Ronald Lee, PAA president from 1986 to 1987, completed his Ph.D. \
at Harvard, where he studied with Nathan Keyfitz, who completed his Ph.D. at \
the University of Chicago with William Fielding Ogburn. What it does not show, \
however, is that Lee also completed an M.A. in demography at Berkeley, where \
Keyfitz was then on the faculty, along with Kingsley Davis and Judith Blake. It \
also does not show that Keyfitz had already worked for several years in Canadian \
statistical agencies before enrolling in graduate school at the University of \
Chicago, where he was known for having taught his advisors as much as they \
taught him. Nor does the genealogy reveal systematic connections between \
population centers, such as the tendency for demographers trained at Chicago to \
teach at Michigan and those trained at Michigan to teach at Wisconsin, as \
described by Susan Greenhalgh in "The Social Construction of Population \
Science." \
<p> \
Of the PAA\'s 69 presidents between 1931 and 2006, 75% (52) were \
sociologists. Just over half (35) can trace their intellectual \
genealogy back to \
Franklin Giddings, known as one of the "four fathers" of modern sociology. \
Frank W. Notestein and Rupert Vance were economists, but their students included both \
economists and sociologists. Of the \
seven economists who have served as PAA president since Thomas (who is generally \
considered to have been a sociologist), all but Ronald \
Lee were students of Thomas, Notestein, or Coale.  \
<p> \
Although Notestein is often considered the grandfather of demography since he was the first \
person to \
hold a faculty position as a demographer, only 10 of the 58 PAA presidents \
who served after him (17%) can trace their intellectual genealogy back to him. \
The work of his intellectual descendants tends to be more focused on \
population mathematics and modeling, whereas the other intellectual descendants of \
Franklin Giddings have tended to focus much more on the social correlates     \
of population dynamics, with an emphasis on fertility. Thomas\'s intellectual \
descendants, like Thomas herself, have focused more than others on internal U.S. \
migration and on population distribution, and those of Roderick McKenzie have \
focused on urban demography.'
