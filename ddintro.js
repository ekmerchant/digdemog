<p>Welcome to <a class="content" href = "index.html">A Digital Reading of Twentieth Century Demography</a>. \
This website began as a digital supplement to the dissertation "Prediction and Control: Global Population, \
Population Science, and Population Politics in the Twentieth Century," which I defended in 2015 as a requirement of the Ph.D. \
program in the Department of History at the University of Michigan. More information about me and about my \
dissertation is available on my <a class="content" href = "../index.html">website</a>. The dissertation traces \
the history of demography &mdash; defined broadly as the study of human population change through mortality, fertility, and migration &mdash; \
from 1920 to 1984, exploring the interplay between demography, global population change, and global population politics. \
The narrative centers on the U.S., but emphasizes the thought and actions of U.S.-based scientists, businessmen, philanthropists, \
and policy-makers vis-a-vis global population.\
<p>While the dissertation examines the reciprocal influence between demography and population politics, programs, and polices \
in the twentieth century, this digital supplement focuses on the science of demography, offering a deeper analysis of the \
development of the field between 1920 and 1984 than I can give in the dissertation. Here I focus on demography\'s practitioners \
and publications, using visual methods to organize and present information. I also hope that this supplement can serve as a \
resource for demographers and for historians of the social sciences who wish to know more about the history of the field in \
the twentieth century. As I revise my dissertation for publication as a monograph, I will continue to develop this website \
as an integral component.\
<p>The website comprises three sections: the first, <a class="content" href="paa/paa.html">Population Association of America</a>, \
examines the history of the PAA, the professional organization for population scientists working in the United States; the second, \
 <a class="content" href="tmod/topicmod.html">Topics in Population Science</a>, employs topic modeling to provide a distant \
(algorithmic) reading of three population-oriented journals established in the twentieth century; the third, \
<a class="content" href="nets/networks.html">Networks in Population Science</a>, employs network diagrams to map relationships \
between scientists and their publications in the field of demography. More details about methods are given on the introductory \
pages for each section, and summary pages explore the meanings and implications of the visuals presented. I constructed all \
visualizations using the <a class="content" href="http://d3js.org">D3</a> library in JavaScript.'
